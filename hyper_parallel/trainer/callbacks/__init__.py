"""
Trainer Callbacks module.

Provides callback system for customizing trainer behavior at various stages of training.

Moved from ``auto_models/trainer/callbacks`` in stage 7 (05 §15.11 step 2);
``TrainerState`` is defined in ``hyper_parallel.trainer.state`` and
re-exported here. The temporary ``TempLogCallback`` alias was dropped —
``TqdmCallback`` is the logging callback it pointed at.
