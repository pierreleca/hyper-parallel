"""VLM (vision-language model) dataset building facade.

Moved from ``components/data/vlm`` in stage 6 (05 §15.10 step 4); this
facade is the only supported import surface for VLM dataset building and
its symbol names and signatures are unchanged by the move. The modality
token-index constants live in ``hyper_parallel.data.vlm.constants``
(split in step 3); the top-level ``hyper_parallel.data`` package does not
re-export VLM symbols flat.
